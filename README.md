# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## How to run

### Clone the project
 git clone https://github.com/isahilsachdev/file-upload-react.git
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

## Libraries Used and Why

I have not used any external library to build ui or for the functionality.
All logic and styles are handwritten and all icons are downloaded.

## What you would do if you had more time

* I'd make better UI for better user experience.
* Would have covered Edge cases.
* Better management of tools or Implementation of state management tools if needed.
